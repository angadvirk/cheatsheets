# React
### **Basic Concepts**
* **What is React:** React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It follows the component-based approach which allows you to build reusable UI components.
* It uses the **Virtual DOM** instead of the Real DOM.
* It uses **Server-side Rendering**.
* It has a **Uni-directional Data Flow** or data binding.
* React's core purpose is to build UI components; it is often referred to as the "V" (View) in an MVC architecture, and can be seamlessly integrated into any application.
